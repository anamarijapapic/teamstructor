### Running the Application

1. Install and update all the requirements above
2. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:anamarijapapic/teamstructor.git`
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
4. Copy `src/teamstructor-app/.env.example` to `src/teamstructor-app/.env`
5. Use Node version defined in `.nvmrc` file by running: `nvm use`
6. Install all JS dependencies by running: `npm install`
7. Install JS dependencies by running: `npm install` from `src/teamstructor-app/` directory
8. Append the line `127.0.0.1   teamstructor.test` to your `/etc/hosts` file
9. Generate your local certificate (setup HTTPS) by running: `npm run addcert`
10. Do a initial build of the website assets by running: `npm run build` from `src/teamstructor-app/` directory
11. Check that Docker Desktop is running, then build and start the local web server for the first time: `docker-compose up`
12. Install Composer dependencies: `docker exec -it teamstructor_php composer install`
13. Generate application key: `docker exec -it teamstructor_php php artisan key:generate`
14. Create symbolic link for storage: `docker exec -it teamstructor_php php artisan storage:link`
15. Alter folder permissions for `src/teamstructor-app/storage` & `src/teamstructor-app/bootstrap` folders: `sudo chmod -R 777 src/teamstructor-app/storage/ src/teamstructor-app/bootstrap/`
16. Open [MinIO Dashboard](http://localhost:9000/) in your browser and login using default root credentials `minioadmin:minioadmin`

17. Run database migrations & seed the database: `docker exec -it teamstructor_php php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`
18. Open [https://teamstructor.test/](https://teamstructor.test/) in your browser
19. Work with the code in the directory.

### Working With the 'dev' Environment

#### Laravel w/ Docker - Notes

To run **Artisan** commands from terminal run command from repo root directory:  
`docker exec -it teamstructor_php php artisan <command>`

#### Useful Docker Commands

- `docker-compose up` starts the docker environment, you can stop it with a single `cmd/ctrl+c`
- `docker-compose build` re-builds all the containers
- `docker-compose stop` stops containers
- `docker-compose down` stops and removes the containers and their volumes
- `docker ps` lists all running containers on the system, useful to track down ones that are unintentionally keeping the ports used.
  Note: All commands must be run at the repo root directory.

#### Managing the Database

A DB administration tool, [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net), is available at http://localhost:8080/.
You can connect to MySQL yourself using the port `3306` on `localhost` from your host. Username and password is `root`.

A simple web interface to manage Redis databases, [phpRedisAdmin](https://github.com/erikdubbelboer/phpRedisAdmin), is available at http://localhost:8085/.

#### Testing Mail Sending

[MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) Web UI, an email testing tool for developers, is available at http://localhost:8025/.
